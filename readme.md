# Cool Project Name 

In this project for my Master's Thesis at University Of Florence (Italy) our aim is to build a system that can profile network users activities using firewall logs.

In this (experimental) version we use a (private) dataset from a local company that allowed our research as a traineship project.

## Installation

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
Then place the dataset named "traffic_dataset".csv in the /datasets/ folder.



## Usage

To run the project:

```bash
python3 api.py
```
It will deploy a (local) REST API,  further information of the usage will be added soon.


## Results
Here some results will be added
